## Go Programming Language Repository ##
<p>
Repository for all things Go-related.
My interest in Go mostly stems from Ken Thompson's involvement
in its development. I'm expecting something like a faster, compiled
(static) version of python. I guess i was hoping for a marriage of
my two main languages; Cpp & Python.

Thanks for checking it out.
